* macOS El Capitan 10.11 and newer macOS releases are supported.
* At least 4GB of RAM
# Install and run Docker for Mac
* Double-click Docker.dmg to open the installer, then drag Moby the whale to the Applications folder.
* Double-click Docker.app in the Applications folder to start Docker. (In the example below, the Applications folder is in “grid” view mode.)
* Login with your docker id, if you done have docker id please create one on below link
  * https://hub.docker.com/signup
# Install Git
* To browse the code of this sample demo you need to install git on your mac machine.
 * Open Terminal of your choice
 * Type git --version on shell
 * This will automatically prompt you to git installer
# Verify your Docker installation
* Open the terminal of your choice.
* Type docker login.
* Enter your username and password created on docker hub.
* Run the below command to run your first container
  * docker run hello-world
# Domain Names for Demo
Write the following config in /etc/hosts file to run all the demo examples from local browser.
 * 127.0.0.1       www.hotdrink.com
 * 127.0.0.1       www.colddrink.com
# Demo Port Requirement
This demo uses following ports
* 80 (To access the test domain on http)
* 443 (To access the test domain on SSL)
* 4443 (To access the test domain on SSL with clientauth enabled)
* 9080 (To Configure CPX via nitro api’s on http)
* 9443 (To configure CPX via nitro api’s on https)
>If any of these ports are not available then test environment will fail to start, in such cases please update docker-compose file with some other free ports.

# Deploying test environment
Chekout the code from github using below link
* git clone https://github.com/mohitsaxena019/CPX-on-MAC.git
>Once the code is downloaded, Navigate to CPX-on-MAC/cpx-demo folder. And use below command to start and stop the test environment. Before starting the test environment please make sure to update the /etc/hosts file with above mentioned domain names.
>>Deploy the demo
* docker-compose up -d
>>Destroy the demo
* docker-compose down
>>To Access the CPX once deployment is up 
* docker exec -it cpx-demo_cpx_1 bash
>>To access CPX CLI once you login to cpx 
* cli_script.sh "show ver"
>>For NITRO API access to CPX
* http://localhost:9080/nitro/v1/config/lbvserver
>>For NITRO API access over HTTPS 
* https://localhost:9443/nitro/v1/config/lbvserver

# Understanding Demo use cases
## Usecase 1: Basic content switching: switch based on domain. Use servicegroups and HTTP monitors.
### Topology
>Relevant configs relating to below procedures are present within cpx.conf file
* Create servicegroups listening on services from hotdrink and coldrink app on port 80
* Create content switching CS vserver listening on HTTP
* Create two dummy lb vservers 
* Create appropriate CS vserver policy and attach the dummy lb vservers
* Add http monitors to lb vserver
* Send a browser request to www.hotdrink.com and www.colddrink.com
## Usecase 2: SSL OFFLOAD:
### Topology
>Relevant configs relating to below procedures are present within cpx.conf file
>Relevant certs are present within certs folder
* Create servicegroups listening on services from hotdrink and colddrink app on port 80
* Create content switching CS Vserver listening on port 443 (SSL)
* Create two dummy lb vservers
* Attach the relevant certs to the vservers
* Create appropriate CS vserver policy and attach the dummy lb vservers
* Send a https browser request to www.hotdrink.com and www.colddrink.com
## Usecase 3: SSL BACKEND:
### Topology 
>Relevant configs relating to below procedures are present within cpx.conf file
>Relevant certs are present within certs folder
* Create servicegroups listening on services from hotdrink and colddrink app on port 443
* Create content switching CS Vserver listening on port 443 (SSL)
* Create two dummy lb vservers
* Attach the relevant certs to the vserver
* Create appropriate CS VServer policy and attach the dummy lb vservers
* Send a https browser request to www.hotdrink.com and www.colddrink.com
* Add new CS and LB vserver for enabling clientauth and serverauth
* Attach the relevant LB vservers with CS vserver for enabling clientauth and serverauth
* Send a https request to www.hotdrink.com and www.colddrink.com
